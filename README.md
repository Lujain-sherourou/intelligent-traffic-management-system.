# intelligent-traffic-management-system.
Developed a system that relies on image analysis using cameras installed at traffic signals. The system counts the number of vehicles in each lane and determines the most congested lane to activate the green light based on traffic density. This project contributes to improving traffic management and reducing vehicle wait times.
